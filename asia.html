                 <h2>Japan</h2>  
                 <p>Sake is the national drink of Japan and is made from rice. It's often called a rice wine, but because of how it's fermented it's actually closer to a beer. It's a very distinct drink for this reason, somewhere between a wine and a beer. It also has a high alcohol content - up to 20%.
 The spirit is historically served with great ceremony and ritual in Japan.</p>

            <h2>Thailand</h2>
        <p>The word "sabai" means "welcome" in Thai, but that's just one of many reasons this drink is considered by many to be the national beverage of Thailand. Another reason is that it's made with Mekhong, Thailand's national spirit. Mekhong is a distilled spirit found only in Thailand and made with sugar cane, molasses, rice and a secret blend of Thai herbs. This is just one Sabai recipe to make you feel truly welcomed in Thailand.

            <h2>Korea</h2>
            <p>Soju is the national distilled drink of Korea, and its neutral flavor makes it a great pairing for the traditionally spicy foods of Korea. Interestingly, Korea's national drink is not actually from Korea ... it was first brought to Korea by invading Mongols during the 13th century. Today it's made in Korea, often made using sweet potatoes, and is the source of immense national pride for Koreans.
