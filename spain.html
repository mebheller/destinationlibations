              <h2>England</h2> 
        <p>Pimm's is a quintessential summer drink. Everybody loves a glass of Pimm's in the summer - and the classic recipe, with lemonade and fruit, is always refreshing. It's a thirst-quenching, supremely summery drink (in England, it's a must at cricket matches) that mixes lemony soda (or ginger ale), fruit, cucumbers, mint and a fortifying shot of gin. It's a gin-based drink that was invented in 1823 by James Pimm, who served it at his oyster bar in London.
